# Rust Based Data Retrieval

## Overview
TTN Data Retrieval is a Rust-based application developed as part of an undergraduate research project. It connects to The Things Network (TTN) via MQTT, retrieves data, and parses it for analysis. This project demonstrates the integration of IoT data streams with backend services.

## Features
- **MQTT Connection**: Securely connects to The Things Network using MQTT.
- **Data Retrieval**: Receives and processes data packets from IoT devices.
- **JSON Parsing**: Custom parsing of JSON payloads from TTN messages.

## Project Status
This repository is part of an ongoing undergraduate research project. It is not intended for general use, and we are currently not seeking external contributions. The repository serves as a record of work in progress and a platform for collaboration among project members.
